## 🛠️ **RLS Functions**

### **Core Security Functions**
```sql
-- Get current user's role
get_heritage100_user_role() → TEXT

-- Check admin privileges
is_heritage100_admin() → BOOLEAN

-- Check manager/admin privileges  
is_heritage100_manager_or_admin() → BOOLEAN

-- Get user's assigned clients
get_heritage100_user_assigned_clients() → UUID[]

-- Check client access permission
can_access_client(client_id UUID) → BOOLEAN
```

## 📋 **Policy Examples**

### **Client Access Control**
```sql
-- Agents can only view their assigned clients
CREATE POLICY "Agents can view assigned clients" ON clients
    FOR SELECT USING (
        get_heritage100_user_role() = 'agent' AND 
        can_access_client(id)
    );
```

### **Property Access Control**
```sql
-- All users can view properties (for matching)
CREATE POLICY "All users can view properties" ON properties
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Only managers/admins can modify properties
CREATE POLICY "Admins and managers can update properties" ON properties
    FOR UPDATE USING (is_heritage100_manager_or_admin());
```

### **Financial Data Protection**
```sql
-- Only managers/admins can access payment data
CREATE POLICY "Admins and managers can view all payments" ON payments
    FOR SELECT USING (is_heritage100_manager_or_admin());
```

## 🧪 **Testing RLS Policies**

### **Test User Setup**
```sql
-- Sample users created for testing
INSERT INTO heritage100_users (email, role) VALUES
('admin@heritage100.com', 'admin'),
('manager@heritage100.com', 'manager'),
('agent@heritage100.com', 'agent');
```

### **Access Testing Scenarios**

#### **Admin Access Test**
```sql
-- Should return all clients
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients; -- Expected: All records
```

#### **Manager Access Test**
```sql
-- Should return all clients and properties
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients; -- Expected: All records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties; -- Expected: All records
```

#### **Agent Access Test**
```sql
-- Should return only assigned clients
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients; -- Expected: Only assigned clients
-- Should return all properties (for matching)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties; -- Expected: All records
```

## 🚨 **Security Features**

### **Data Isolation**
- ✅ **Agent isolation**: Agents cannot access other agents' clients
- ✅ **Financial protection**: Only managers/admins access payments
- ✅ **User data protection**: Users can only see their own profile
- ✅ **Audit trail**: All access is logged and traceable

### **Privilege Escalation Prevention**
- ✅ **Role-based functions**: Security-definer functions prevent privilege escalation
- ✅ **Assignment validation**: Client assignments are validated server-side
- ✅ **Cross-table consistency**: Related data access is consistently enforced

### **Production Security**
- ✅ **No bypass mechanisms**: All access goes through RLS policies
- ✅ **Function security**: All helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage**: Every table and operation is secured

## 🔧 **Configuration Management**

### **Adding New Users**
```sql
-- Create new agent user
INSERT INTO heritage100_users (
    email, first_name, last_name, role, 
    assigned_clients, permissions
) VALUES (
    'new.agent@heritage100.com', 'New', 'Agent', 'agent',
    ARRAY['client-uuid-1', 'client-uuid-2']::UUID[],
    ARRAY['client:read', 'client:write', 'property:read']
);
```

### **Updating Client Assignments**
```sql
-- Assign clients to agent
UPDATE heritage100_users 
SET assigned_clients = ARRAY['client-uuid-1', 'client-uuid-2']::UUID[]
WHERE email = 'agent@heritage100.com';
```

### **Role Changes**
```sql
-- Promote agent to manager
UPDATE heritage100_users 
SET role = 'manager',
    permissions = ARRAY['client:read', 'client:write', 'property:read', 'property:write', 'analytics:read']
WHERE email = 'agent@heritage100.com';
```

## 🎯 **AI Agent Integration**

### **Secure AI Operations**
The RLS policies ensure that:
- ✅ **AI agent queries** respect user permissions
- ✅ **Data updates** are validated against user roles
- ✅ **Client assignments** are enforced automatically
- ✅ **Audit trails** capture all AI-initiated changes

### **AI Agent User Setup**
```sql
-- Create AI agent user with appropriate permissions
INSERT INTO heritage100_users (
    email, first_name, last_name, role, permissions
) VALUES (
    'ai-agent@heritage100.com', 'AI', 'Agent', 'manager',
    ARRAY['client:read', 'client:write', 'property:read', 'analytics:read']
);
```
