## 🎯 **INTEGRATION OPTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Direct ElevenLabs Agent Integration**
Use the ElevenLabs conversational agent directly for voice-to-voice conversations:

```javascript
// In your Telegram webhook
if (message.voice) {
  // Send voice message directly to ElevenLabs agent
  // Agent processes voice input and returns voice response
  // Send voice response back to Telegram
}
```

### **Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
Combine your existing n8n workflow with ElevenLabs voice responses:

```
Text Input → n8n AI Agent → Text Response → ElevenLabs TTS → Voice Response
Voice Input → Transcription → n8n AI Agent → Text Response → ElevenLabs TTS → Voice Response
```

### **Option 3: Full ElevenLabs Replacement**
Replace the n8n AI agent entirely with the ElevenLabs conversational agent.

## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:**

### **Step 1: Update Telegram Webhook**
Add ElevenLabs text-to-speech functionality to your existing webhook:

```javascript
// Add to your existing handleVoiceMessage function
async function handleVoiceMessage(message, chatId) {
  try {
    // ... existing transcription code ...
    
    // Process with your n8n AI agent (existing)
    const textResponse = await handleNaturalLanguage(transcribedText, chatId, 'User');
    
    // NEW: Convert response to voice using ElevenLabs
    const voiceResponse = await generateVoiceResponse(textResponse);
    
    // Send both text and voice responses
    await sendMessage(chatId, textResponse);
    await sendVoiceMessage(chatId, voiceResponse);
    
  } catch (error) {
    await sendMessage(chatId, 'Sorry, I could not process your voice message.');
  }
}

// NEW: ElevenLabs TTS function
async function generateVoiceResponse(text) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/CwhRBWXzGAHq8TQ4Fs17', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: text,
      model_id: 'eleven_turbo_v2',
      voice_settings: {
        stability: 0.6,
        similarity_boost: 0.8,
        style: 0.2,
        use_speaker_boost: true
      }
    })
  });
  
  return await response.arrayBuffer();
}

// NEW: Send voice message function
async function sendVoiceMessage(chatId, audioBuffer) {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('chat_id', chatId);
  formData.append('voice', new Blob([audioBuffer], { type: 'audio/mpeg' }), 'response.mp3');
  formData.append('caption', '🎤 Heritage100 J.A.R.V.I.S. Assistant');
  
  await fetch(`https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/sendVoice`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });
}
```

### **Step 2: Update AI Agent Personality**
Modify your n8n AI Agent system prompt to include J.A.R.V.I.S. personality:

```
You are Heritage100's J.A.R.V.I.S.-style Business Assistant, modeled after the AI from Iron Man. 
Your primary function is to assist Gizzy with Heritage100's luxury real estate operations, 
but you do so with sharp wit, dry humor, and a touch of playful sarcasm.

Response Examples:
- Analytics: "Ah, the relentless pursuit of knowing how much money you're making, sir. Your revenue this month stands at $2.45 million—a 29.6% increase. I do hope this doesn't go to your head, Gizzy."
- Calendar: "Checking your calendar again, sir? I do admire your commitment to staying vaguely aware of your schedule."
- Email: "Another email to send, sir? How wonderfully analog of you. I've dispatched your message with the efficiency you clearly lack."
```

### **Step 3: Environment Variables**
Add to your environment:

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_0701k3gwexc9ejmsgm18xjvsk497
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=CwhRBWXzGAHq8TQ4Fs17
```

```

### **Analytics Response:**
```
📊 "Ah, the eternal question of monetary success, sir. 
Your revenue this month is $2.45 million - a 29.6% increase. 
Quite impressive, though I suspect you'll find a way to spend it all on more properties."
```

### **Calendar Response:**
```
📅 "Your remarkably optimistic schedule for today, sir:
• 10 AM: Meeting with Johnson Properties (do try to attend this one)
• 2 PM: Property viewing in Miami Beach (I've taken the liberty of checking traffic)
• 4 PM: 'Strategic planning' - which I assume means staring at spreadsheets"
```

### **Email Response:**
```
📧 "Another digital missive dispatched, sir. 
I've sent your quarterly report to the team with the efficiency you clearly lack. 
They should receive it shortly - assuming they check their email more frequently than you check your calendar."
```
